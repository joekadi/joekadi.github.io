I am software engineer and consultant freelancer working remotely, for now. I actively share what I learn over on my <a href="https://joekadi.medium.com/">blog</a>.
I graduated - in May 2021 - with a MSci in Computing Science from The University Of Glasgow where I had the opporuntity to research uncertainty calibration methods for Deep Neural Networks in Inverse Reinforcement Learning and build various applications for a range of clients. Whilst studying I co-founded <a href="https://www.toceglasgow.com/">TÃ“CE</a>, worked part time as a full stack software engineer and tutored students in computing science.  
If you have a project you think I could help with, or just want to chat, don't hesistate to <a href="mailto:contact@joekadi.com">get in touch</a>!
