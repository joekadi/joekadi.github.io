I am software and ML engineering freelancer working remotely, for now. 

I graduated - in May 2021 - with a MSci in Computing Science from The University Of Glasgow where I had the opporuntity to research uncertainty calibration methods for Deep Neural Networks in Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Whilst studying I co-founded <a href="https://www.toceglasgow.com/">TÓCE</a>, worked part time as a full stack software engineer and tutored students in computing science.  
I now actively freelance as a software and ML engineer and <a href="https://joekadi.medium.com/">write</a> about anything that interests me!
